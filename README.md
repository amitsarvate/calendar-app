# C++ Calendar Application 

- - - -

## Overview 

This project was written as one of my lab assignments during my time in the course CSCI 1060 (Programming Workshop I). Essentially, the user is given an two options -

1. Display the calendar of a month of a particular year 
2. Display the entire years calendar (all 12 months' calendars are displayed) 

## Significance 

This program puts together the elementary basics of C++ and a special algorithm to determine what specific day of the week a particular day within a month of a year 
falls on and therefore will always produce a calendar that is correct for the user to view.
